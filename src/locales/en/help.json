  "Faqs": "FAQS",
  "GeneralInformation": "General Information",
  "HowTo": "Click on a question below to review the information pertaining to the subject.",
  "Guardian": "What is the Guardian?",
  "GuardianAns": "UMG’s Content Protection Guardian is a “one-stop shop” for all your Content Protection and Anti-Piracy needs. Here, users can set up new releases for anti-piracy protection services, including: content protection, leak detection and monitoring, web-crawling and takedowns from unlicensed platforms, establish territorial rights and set post-release UGC blocking policies.",
  "GuardianAnsSub": "Have a question or need help getting started? Contact us directly at ",
  "GuardianAccount": "How do I create an account for The Guardian?",
  "GuardianAccountAns": "To create an account, you just need to select the “Request Access” option on the welcome page. The Guardian is already set-up to work with your Okta account. So, if you already have an Okta account, you’re all ready to log in!",
  "AntiPiracy": "How soon should projects be submitted for anti-piracy protection?",
  "AntiPiracyAns": "The short answer is “as soon as possible.” The earlier any information is added to The Guardian, the better chance we have of detecting and suppressing a leak. Our greatest successes have occurred when we were well ahead of the game on project setup!",
  "Difference": "What's the difference between pre-release and post-release?",
  "DifferenceAns": "For our purposes, the pre-release period is considered to be the time period PRIOR to the primary commercial release date of the title in question. Post-release is considered to be the time period following the primary commercial release date of that title.",
  "HowToAdd": "Someone else has some of the information for my project. How can they add it?",
  "HowToAddAns": "The Guardian was actually designed to be a collaborative platform, allowing multiple users to work together on projects. So, as long as the other user is a part of your label group OR they are included in the additional contacts for the project in Step 2: Project Contacts, they will be able to add any necessary information to your project.",
  "AccountSetup": "I work with multiple labels in UMG. How should I set up my account?",
  "AccountSetupAns": "The Guardian allows you to be assigned to as many label groups as you need. Just enter in each label you work with when initially requesting access. Once you’re approved, you’ll be ready to work with each label.",
  "AddLabel": "I need to add another label group to my account. What do I do?",
  "AddLabelAns": "You can send this request to ",
  "AddLabelAnsSub": " and a Guardian administrator will have your account updated as soon as possible.",
  "TotallyLost": "What if I feel totally lost?",
  "TotallyLostAns": "No worries! Please see our instructional videos or for a general overview as well as specific tutorials for each step to get started. You can always come back to the FAQ section for more information.",
  "TotallyLostAnsSub": "If you’re still unsure of how to proceed or just want some guidance from an actual human being, please reach out to us directly at ",
  "TotallyLostAnsSub1": " and someone on our team will respond as soon as possible!",
  "ReleaseInfo": "Release Info",
  "FindRelease": "How do I find and existing project/release?",
  "FindReleaseAns": "Once you log in, click on “Find a Project” at the top of the screen and either scroll down or search for a project as you would on any other platform",
  "CreateProject": "How do I create a new project/release to submit for anti-piracy protection?",
  "CreateProjectAns": "Once you log in, click on “New Project” at the top of the screen and either scroll down or search for a project as you would on any other platform.",
  "CreateProject1": "Can I create a project if the name isn't finalized yet?",
  "CreateProject1Ans": "Yes, you can either enter a working title or write “TBD” in the Project Title field. Until the project has been submitted, you’ll still have the ability to go back and update the title at a later date.",
  "UnknownReleaseDate": "What if I don't know the release date yet?",
  "UnknownReleaseDateAns": "Just select “TBD” in the Release TBD checkbox. You can always edit this field at a later date.",
  "ProjectContacts": "Project Contacts",
  "Collaborate": "Who can view and/or collaborate on a project?",
  "CollaborateAns": "In essence, Project Security allows you to choose the level of visibility for the project that you’re creating.",
  "CollaborateAnsSub": "When a project is set to “Public”, it can be viewed and edited by anyone who is assigned to your label group (e.g. Republic Records). Whereas a project that is set to “Private” will only be viewable and editable by those Guardian users that have been included in the “Additional Contacts” field. So, choose wisely!",
  "PrimaryContact": "What does \"Primary Contact\" mean? Who should I put in that field?",
  "PrimaryContactAns": "The primary contact is the main point person for a particular project. You can think of them as the lead project manager for that project. Anyone that is included in the “Additional Contacts” field will be included on any correspondence related to that project as well.",
  "AudioFiles": "Audio Files",
  "Finalmasters": "What if I don’t have the final masters yet?",
  "FinalmastersAns": "Setting up a project either with early mixes or even demo versions is perfectly fine. Even after you’ve finalized and submitted a project in Guardian, just send an email to ",
  "FinalmastersAnsSub": " and we can add in the updated audio versions for your project.",
  "WithoutReleaseInfo": "Can I set up a release for anti-piracy WITH audio but WITHOUT release info?",
  "WithoutReleaseInfoAns": "Unfortunately, no. Our systems will at least require some tentative information including artist name, a working project title and working track titles to begin.",
  "WithoutReleaseInfoAnsSub": "You may upload audio files if you have them but they cannot be submitted without a corresponding ISRC. Go to Step 3: Audio Files (video hyperlink here?) of a project to get started and for more info.",
  "Replaceaudiofiles": "How do I replace audio files?",
  "ReplaceaudiofilesAns": "Under the “Actions” column in Step 3: Audio Files, click the upward pointing arrow (insert icon here?) to replace the existing audio file, then click “Save” or “Save & Continue” to move on to the next step.",
  "Watermark": "Are the audio files I submit watermarked?",
  "WatermarkAns": "YES! UMG’s Content Protection group has a long-standing policy to NOT accept unwatermarked audio. But, if you have any particular concerns about the security of your music, please feel free to reach out to ",
  "TrackInfo": "Track Info",
  "WithoutAudioFiles": "Can I set up a release for anti-piracy without audio files?",
  "WithoutAudioFilesAns": "Yes, that’s no problem! The Guardian will allow you to create a project with as much or as little information as you have available at that time.",
  "WithoutAudioFilesAnsSub": "If you have track information (e.g. artist, title, release date, ISRC) you can submit that to begin web-crawling services which means that our systems can begin searching right away for a potential leak. Go to Step 4: Track Info (video hyperlink here?) of a project to get started and for more info.",
  "Submitting": "Who actually gets to view the release information I'm submitting?",
  "SubmittingAns": "While the UMG Guardian platform is a highly secure system, a limited number of people may have access to the information you submit. They are all focused on anti-piracy however and have the utmost respect for our music and artists.",
  "SubmittingAnsSub": "If you have any particular concerns about the security of your release information, please feel free to reach out to ",
  "TerroritorialRightsNeed": "What are \"Territorial Rights Sets\" and why do I need them?",
  "TerroritorialRightsNeedAns": "Territorial Rights sets (Step 5) allow you specify exactly where in the world UMG owns or distributes the various tracks in your project. It’s especially important to do this if you intend to either block or monetize UGC in those territories.",
  "TerroritorialRightsNeedAnsSub": "Note that, if UMG does NOT have ownership or distribution rights in a territory, we cannot take either of these actions.",
  "TerritorialRightsSet": "How do I create a \"Territorial Rights Set\"?",
  "TerritorialRightsSetAns": "After creating a new Rights Set, simply click and drag titles to assign them to the appropriate rights set, then select the proper territories where UMG has or does not have rights.",
  "ReviewAndSubmit": "Review And Submit",
  "AfterSubmitChange": "What can I change after submitting a project?",

  "PostReleaseUGCBlocking": "Post-Release UGC Blocking",
  "PostReleaseUGCBlock": "What is Post-Release UGC Blocking?",
  "PostReleaseUGCBlockAns": "Post-Release UGC Blocking allows for a Guardian user to establish a specific rule set for when and where UGC (User Generated Content) for a particular title(s) should be blocked after commercial release.",
  "PostReleaseUGCBlockAnsSub": "Default UMG policy is to block content during the pre-release stage following a leak and later monetize upon commercial release date. However, UGC blocking can be extended beyond release date as needed (subject to approval). In Step 6, if you do NOT create a post-release block policy, UGC will be set to monetize on all licensed platforms once a title is released.",
  "PostReleaseBlock": "Do I need to set up Post-release blocking?",
  "PostReleaseBlockAns": "Not at all! While we encourage doing this for high priority releases, at least for a period of time, this is an OPTIONAL step. If you have any questions on post-release UGC blocking, please email us directly at ",
  "NoBlockingPolicy": "What happens if I don't create any blocking policies on this page?",
  "NoBlockingPolicyAns": "Our default policy is block content pre-release and to monetize content on licensed platforms upon commercial release. So, if you don’t set any blocking policies in Step 6, we will monetize on all platforms once released.",
  "IndefiniteDate": "I can't seem to choose an indefinite date for my blocking policy set, what should I do?",
  "IndefiniteDateAns": "If you do not input a date in the “Blocked Until” field, UGC blocking will continue indefinitely.",
  "Blockingdurations": "I'm confused about blocking durations (e.g. >30 sec, ?1:00, etc.) Can you explain?",
  "BlockingdurationsAns": "Choosing one of these options means that we will block posts OVER that duration (e.g. posts over 30-seconds, over 1-min, etc.)",
  "3PostRelease": "I want to create more than 3 Post-Release Blocking Policies? Can I do this?",
  "3PostReleaseAns": "While the number of blocking policies in Guardian is set to a maximum of 3, you can send special requests to ",
  "3PostReleaseAnsSub": " and a Guardian administrator will be able to assist you.",
  "ChangeAfterRelease": "How do I change post-release blocking policies AFTER release?",
